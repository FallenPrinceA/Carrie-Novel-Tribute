    <img id="img-div image img-caption="Carrie White" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-32VbRWRVdNA/XL-eeEJ7ugI/AAAAAAAAphE/ReRjah5nUhUennnohKCky9a-fxuxckUGQCLcBGAs/s1600/Carrie-2013.jpg" alt="Carrie" class="center">
    <p style="color: #C21E56">Carrie White, is an unpopular friendless and bullied high-school girl from an abusive religious household who uses her newly discovered telekinetic powers to exact revenge on those who torment her. Carrie White due to her upbringing is shown to be a bit naive and clueless regarding things even her own body. Her character turning point features a mixture of emotional highs and emotional downs. After being severly bullied, the boy of her dream asks her to prom and she is elected prom queen only to be drowned in a pool of blood before Tommy is killed by a metal bucket falling on his head. Afterwards she uses her psychic powers to enact revenge on those who torment her, which causes one of the worse natural disasters in her town's history. Carrie is the sterotypical classic anti-hero, after being bullied, tormented, and abused by her classmates in her only moment of happiness she watched her life get turned upside down in the most tragic way possible. </p>

Susan represents the "fairy good mother" in the story as she tries to help Carrie have her special night after all the horrible things she endured during her life. She is one of the few who survives Carrie's desturction on Prom Night however due to being crucified in public opinion, as her and Tommy are blamed for pushing Carrie to her breaking point, in the sequels it is revealed that she became a guidance counselor to atone for her sins. Carrie however at the end of the novel, believing Susan had planned this from the start digs into her mind, only to find her intentions were innocent. </p>

  <h2>Fun Facts about Carrie By Stephen Kings</h2>
    <ol class="facts">
      <li>Carrie is one of the most frequently banned books in United States schools, because of Carrie‚Äôs violence, cursing, underage sex and negative view of religion.</li>
      <li>Much of the book uses newspaper clippings, magazine articles, letters, and excerpts from books to tell how Carrie destroyed the fictional town of Chamberlain, Maine while exacting revenge on her sadistic classmates and her own mother Margaret.</li>
      <li>Carrie was actually King's fourth novel (the other three being Rage, The Long Walk and Blaze), but it was the first one to be published. It was written while he was living in a trailer, on a portable typewriter (on which he also wrote Misery) that belonged to his wife Tabitha. It began as a short story intended for Cavalier magazine, but King tossed the first three pages of his work in the garbage can.</li>
